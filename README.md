## Steps for iOS
Steps is a simple step counting widget for iOS written in Swift. It uses App Groups to share data between the container app and widget and UIVisualEffectView for blurring. It uses the CMPedometer API in iOS 8 to show steps and distance, and floors climbed on devices that support it.
